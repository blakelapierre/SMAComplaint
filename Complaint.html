	<p>Complaint Against <span class="dee">the</span> Administrator</p><p><span class="dee">of the</span> 401 (k) Plan <span class="dee">and</span> Group Health Plan</p><p><span class="dee">of</span> Software Marketing Associates, Inc.</p><p><span class="dee">also known as</span> SMA</p>
</div>

<div id="intro">
The Administrator, Trustee, and Employer of the 401(k) Plan and Group Health Plan at SMA has, at the very least:
<ol>
	<li><strong>Extracted a Personal Financial Benefit</strong> for herself and her husband, the co-Trustee, <strong>at the Direct Expense of a Participant</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Discriminately Invoked</strong> clauses in the 401(k) Plan to achieve her Personal Financial Benefit</li>
	<li><strong>Misrepresented and Withheld</strong> material terms of the 401(k) Plan in order to achieve and maintain her Personal Financial Benefit</li>
	<li><strong>Refuses to Execute</strong> the administrative claims procedure of the 401(k) Plan to maintain her Personal Financial Benefit</li>
	<li><strong>Refuses to Provide</strong> access to 401(k) Plan and Group Health Plan documents</li>
	<li><strong>Denied Benefits</strong> guaranteed under COBRA</li>
	<li><strong>Refuses to Provide</strong> instructions on how to file an administrative claim against the Group Health Plan</li>
</ol>

Substantial and overwhelming evidence of these allegations has been collected, documented, and brought to the Administrator's attention.

The <strong>Administrator refuses to act on or dispute</strong> this evidence or the allegations they support.

I am not aware of any fact that contradicts any aspect of these allegations. Likewise, the Administrator has been unable to supply such a fact.

<h2>Background</h3>
I was an employee of Software Marketing Associates, Inc. from September 2007 to June 15, 2012. SMA and I had an extremely simple contract, including an employer match on my 401 (k) contributions up to 6% of my annual salary, starting after the first year of our relationship. Our contract did not specify an exact schedule for the distribution of the matching funds, but over the period of our contract <a href="Evidence/Contributions.pdf">SMA made employer matching contributions</a> roughly every three months. The contributions were equal to exactly the amounts I contributed to my Account for a given quarter of the Plan's fiscal year. On some occasions, the Administrator personally notified myself and other employees that the "quarterly match" had been contributed to Participant Accounts.

<strong>On June 18, 2012 the Administrator removed assets from my Account.</strong> The Administrator never notified me of this action (either before or after); it was only discovered later when I was reviewing my Account statement.

<span class="note">Note: The contributions worksheet, linked above, was provided by the Administrator and makes an inaccurate statement regarding the vesting status of my Account. Contrary to this worksheet, my Account is fully vested. The Administrator does not dispute the vesting status of my Account and its vesting status is not related to this Complaint, other than through this Note.</span>

<h2>The Administrator's Claims</h3>
The Administrator now makes many dubious and contradictory claims, including that at least two (2) of the thirteen (13) employer matching contributions made to my Account were actually <a href="#linda">"advances"</a>. The Administrator claims that I had to be employed on a specific day of the year (June 30) to be <a href="#linda">"eligible for the discretionary match"</a>; that SMA <a href="#linda">"had to take the advances back because [I was] not eligible to receive them"</a>; and that <a href="#jim">"recovery of [my] pre-payments is compulsory - not optional"</a>. The Administrator first claimed that the "advances" are made <a href="#linda">"as a courtesy"</a> to employees, but later claimed that the <a href="#jim">"partial payments"</a> are actually made <strong><a href="#jim">"solely for [their] convenience in smoothing out [their] cash flow"</a>, if <a href="#jim">"[their] profits permit"</a></strong>.

The Administrator claims that I <a href="#jim">"misunderst[ood]"</a> their benefits, and asserts that it is a <strong><a href="#jim">fact</a></strong> that I was <strong>not <a href="#jim">"unfairly cheated out of a benefit that [I] thought [I] earned"</a></strong>.

The Administrator claims that it made a <a href="#linda">"mistake of fact"</a> when it <a href="#linda">"anticipat[ed] that [I] would still be an employee at 06/30/2012"</a>.


<strong>The Administrator had no basis, and provides no rationale, for its belief that it would be a fact that I would be an employee of SMA on June 30, 2012. SMA's "Disclaimer", distributed by the Administrator, states, <a href="Evidence/Disclaimer2.png">"[t]he basic employment relationship at SMA is of an at-will nature and there is no specified length or guarantee of employment"</a></strong>. No type of relationship other than the basic employment relationship was offered to me by SMA.

The Administrator's claims are an appeal to the authority of documents that were first made known and distributed to me fully one (1) month <strong>AFTER</strong> the Administrator injured my Account. 

<strong>I will show that the Administrator selectively picks clauses from these documents to support its position while continually and blatantly misrepresenting and disregarding the balance of the documents.</strong>

<h2>The Administrator Disregards Fact and Evidence</h3>
The Administrator's claims are in direct contradiction with the contract between myself and SMA, as well as in direct contradiction with every representation that the Administrator, Trustees, SMA or any employee of SMA ever made to me or to other former and current employees of SMA, as well as in direct contradiction with <strong>a document distributed by the Administrator that explicitly states <a href="Evidence/PayAdvances.png">"SMA does not provide pay advances on unearned wages to associates."</a></strong> This document was distributed to me by the Administrator just five (5) months prior to the Administrator making these claims.

I have spoken to a number of current and former associates of SMA, including multiple Vice Presidents; none were aware that the employer matching contributions were "advances" or that there was only a single day of the year that one could be employed in order to not have their "advances" taken back.

A Vice President told me, "this would not have happened a year ago". I believe this statement to be in reference to the Administrator not taking the same actions, in the same circumstances, a year prior, when other employees had left the company. Furthermore, at least one of these former employees has also alleged that the Administrator did not take the same actions against him.

The Administrator does not acknowledge or dispute these facts or evidence.


<h2>The Administrator Occludes Fact and Evidence</h3>
I have requested documents from the Administrator that will provide definitive answers to most of my allegations.

SMA rules, policies, and procedures require the Administrator to conduct <a href="Evidence/BusinessEthicsAndConduct2.png">"prompt, full, thorough and fair investigation[s]"</a> into my claims. The Plan documents require that my appeal of the Administrator's initial determination <a href="Evidence/Software Marketing.sum.pdf">"must be given a full and fair review"</a>. Furthermore, the Plan documents state that the Administrator must conduct a hearing where I <a href="Evidence/SMA 401k - Section 2.pdf">"shall have an opportunity to review all documents in the possession of the Administrator which are pertinent to the claim at issue and its disallowance"</a>.

In the nine months that I have been trying to resolve this situation, <strong>the Administrator has disguised documents, provided contradictory information, ignored requests for information about Plan procedures, and had one of its employees yell at and threaten me for submitting written requests for documents in accordance with SMA policies and Plan procedures.

The Administrator refuses to reveal documents that will definitively prove or disprove these allegations.</strong>


<h2>The Administrator Is Impervious To Fact, Evidence, and Argument</h3>
Without conducting a hearing, the Administrator proceeded to make a <strong>Final Decision</strong> that made no mention of the claims I have made. The Plan documents require that a <a href="Evidence/Software Marketing.sum.pdf">"full and fair review"</a> will <a href="Evidence/Software Marketing.sum.pdf">"take into account all comments, documents, records and other information"</a> submitted to the Administrator, including the <a href="Evidence/SMA 401k - Section 2.pdf">"written and oral evidence and arguments"</a> that I did not have an opportunity to submit, because the Administrator did not conduct a hearing. The Plan requires that these comments, documents, records, evidence, and arguments be taken into account <a href="Evidence/Software Marketing.sum.pdf">"without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination"</a>.

The <strong>Final Decision</strong> is almost entirely a verbatim copy of the Administrator's initial determination. <strong>The Final Decision does not reference or acknowledge any comment, document, record, fact, evidence, argument or any other information that has been submitted to the Administrator regarding my claims.</strong>

I have tried to make the Administrator aware of these faults as they occurred. The Administrator will not reference or acknowledge the faults.


<h2>Documentation Of Fact, Evidence, and Argument</h3>
Currently, the documentation of the facts, evidence and arguments is in the form of this Complaint and a series of <a href="#jim">"communications"</a> between myself, other employees of the company, and the Administrator. These communications occurred over a period of about seven months and contain detailed explanations of the above allegations and the evidence that supports them. 

In addition to the violations enumerated above, I believe the Administrator has committed numerous other violations of the documents that govern the Plan as well as SMA's rules, policies and procedures. Some of these violations I have pointed out in the following communications; others, I have not yet spent the time to document or fully analyze, but will should it become necessary.

The communications between myself and the Administrator are presented in chronological order immediately following the links below. The communications primarily occurred via email, but a small portion of them were sent by the Administrator via tracked courier. Some of the communications were verbal and are noted appropriately. Communications from myself are highlighted with a darker background. I have tried to present all of the communications accurately.

Likewise, I have not scanned all seventy-six (76) pages of the Associate Handbook. If full copies of these documents are required the Administrator should be able to provide them.</div>

Hi Denise,

I was reviewing my 401k account and noticed two withdrawals dated 6/18/2012:

$-1,287.87 MISTAKE OF FACT
$-1,315.55 MISTAKE OF FACT

I contacted T. Rowe Price and they said that these withdrawals were initiated by the plan administrator. I don't see any recent corresponding errant contributions that these withdrawals are correcting for.

Please let me know what these transactions are regarding.


Thanks,

<blockquote class="sma">
Blake,
 
The two Mistake of Fact withdrawals relate to the discretionary company match.
 
The Software Marketing Associates, Inc. 401k Plan document states that in order to be eligible for the discretionary Employer match a participant must be employed as of the end of the plan year, June 30.  If a participant is not employed by SMA on 06/30, they are not eligible for the discretionary match for the entire plan year 07/01 – 06/30.
 
Per the Plan document, the discretionary matching formula is to be calculated and funded at the end of the plan year.  On occasion, as a courtesy, SMA will advance some of the anticipated matching funds to participants accounts during the plan year but the actual discretionary match is calculated and funded per the Plan document after 06/30.
 
Due to the fact that you were no longer an employee of SMA on 06/30/12, you were not eligible for the discretionary employer match.  The company made two advances to your account in anticipation that you would still be an employee at 06/30/12, but had to take the advances back because you were not eligible to receive them.  T.Rowe refers to this as a Mistake of Fact.
 
 
Thank you.

Hi Denise,
 
I was reviewing my 401k account and noticed two withdrawals dated 6/18/2012:
 
$-1,287.87 MISTAKE OF FACT
$-1,315.55 MISTAKE OF FACT
 
I contacted T. Rowe Price and they said that these withdrawals were initiated by the plan administrator. I don't see any recent corresponding errant contributions that these withdrawals are correcting for.
 
Please let me know what these transactions are regarding.
 
 
Thanks,
 
Blake La Pierre

Hi Denise & Jodi,

I was disappointed to learn that a clawback provision was invoked to make two withdrawals from my 401(k) account. This type of action is not characteristic of our professional relationship.

The employer match was always represented as part of my overall compensation that was distributed quarterly and I relied on that representation as part of our employment contract.

Please restore the funds that were withdrawn from my 401(k) account. Please also send me a copy of the Plan Document that governs the distribution of contributions to plan participants. An electronic copy attached to an email is acceptable and preferable. If not available, I can come to the office to pick up a copy or you can mail it to:

Hi Denise & Jodi,

Please send me the full legal plan document that governs contributions as requested. The document that you sent me explicitly denies being the requested document:

"This SPD describes the Plan's benefits and obligations as contained in the legal Plan document, which governs the operation of the Plan. 
The Plan document is written in much more technical and precise language and is designed to comply with applicable legal requirements. If 
the non-technical language in this SPD and the technical, legal language of the Plan document conflict, the Plan document always governs. 
If you wish to receive a copy of the legal Plan document, please contact the Administrator."

I don't understand why you are taking this action. Is there something that I did to upset you? 

As I said in my previous email: as part of the terms of my employment you represented that the 401(k) matching contributions were part of my total compensation and it that was distributed quarterly. You have taken away part of my earned compensation that was given to me over 6 months ago. Please return the money to the account immediately.

<header>On this day, I had plans to meet a colleague downtown. As SMA's office is on the route from my house to the downtown area, I stopped by SMA's office to speak with Denise and Jodi Dixon, my former immediate supervisor. Denise had left the office early, but Jodi arranged a conference call between the three of us.

During the call, Denise told me that she would not return what was removed from my account. She told me that the 401 (k) Plan was not misrepresented. She told me that there was nothing she could do to return the assets. She then proceeded to talk over me whenever I attempted to speak, began to raise her voice, and then unilaterally ended the call by disconnecting in the middle of our conversation.</header>

</header>
<blockquote class="blake">
Denise, Jim, and Jodi,

As I know you can sympathize, I do not appreciate having my money taken from me. I also do not appreciate having to play the role of debt collector. As I discussed with you previously, it was my intention to spend this time working on personal projects and developing technical skills.

The offer that was made to me in exchange for providing you with my labor and skills included but may not be limited to:

Negotiated salary
15 days paid vacation per year
Health insurance
401k plan with a maximum match of 6% of my salary after the first year of our relationship


Your offer was accepted and, despite an early disagreement over the number of paid vacation days we had agreed to, both sides kept to our contract.

According to the records I have available, beginning on February 3, 2009 and ending on January 10, 2012 the company made a series of thirteen match deposits into my 401k account in accordance with our contract at a rate of four times per calendar year. On several occasions throughout that time period Denise informed myself and other employees that the company match had been deposited into our 401k accounts. 

On June 18, 2012, three days after our contract ended, you decided to remove $2,603.42 worth of assets from my 401k account. 

On July 16, 2012 I became aware of your breach. After attempting to contact Denise to see why the assets were confiscated from my account, I was given a response by Linda Simmons claiming that most of the thirteen deposits were actually "advances" and that because I was not an employee on June 30, 2012 some of the "advances" were taken back.

Frankly, this argument is absurd and insulting. 

No reasonable person would ever assume that compensation given to them in accordance with our contract was an "advance", nor that they would have to be an employee on an undisclosed day to be "eligible" to keep the "advance". In fact, the "Associate Handbook", dated February 1, 2012 and given to us by Denise around that time, states:


	"SMA does not provide pay advances on unearned wages to associates."


At no point up until July 16, 2012 had there been any mention that part of our contract was dependent on my being employed on a specific day of the year. Nor was there ever any representation that part of my compensation was an "advance". And in fact, as noted above, the company explicitly disclaims giving compensation advances.

While I cannot say that I am surprised by the recent behavior of your company, it is disappointing to see such a lack of integrity and professionalism on blatant display. Your actions have not gone unnoticed.

What pains me the most is that last Tuesday, July 18 I was again contacted by one of my former colleagues for support and, because of your actions, I had to tell him that I did not feel it was appropriate for me to provide any further support for the work I performed for your company because you had taken money from me.

While I do not wish to litigate this breach with you, I do reserve right to pursue the maximum damages allowed to me under the law, including at a jury trial. At this time I believe there is enough preliminary evidence in my favor that along with evidence gathered during discovery I would prevail on arguments of breach of contract, fraud in the factum, fraud in the inducement, retaliation and breach of fiduciary duty.

Please inform your employees that as long as your company is in possession of my money and remains in breach of our contract, I will be unable to continue providing them with support.

Dear: Blake:
 
Please stop sending annoying and threatening communications to us. If you feel that you have a cause of action, I urge you to retain an attorney and pursue this matter through the civil courts.
 
I would like to point out a few features of our generous 401k program to you:
	1)  The 401(k) is an SMA employee benefit (Section 301 of the Associate Handbook.)                                                                                                                     

	2)  SMA matches up to the legal maximum of 6% if our profits permit.
	3)  Payments to the 401k program are due 90 days after the completion of our fiscal year (ending June 30th)
	4) SMA elects to make partial payments during the fiscal year solely for our convenience in smoothing out our cash flow.
	5) SMA is subject to all relevant federal laws regulating 401k programs which we comply with.
	
6)      Every year our plan is subject to an extensive compliance testing process which we have always passed.

7)      The recovery of your pre-payments is compulsory – not optional.

 
I  can understand that based on your misunderstanding of our benefits, you feel that you have been unfairly cheated out of a benefit that you thought you earned. In fact, this is not the case.
 
We are disappointed that if asked, you won’t be available to help with any work that we paid you to perform here that is not working properly. We will have to learn to live with the disappointment.

<blockquote class="blake">
Denise, Jim and Jodi,

Please read this letter in its entirety as parts of it require a response from you.

It has now been two months since I discovered your breaches. You have made it very clear that you have no intention of returning my money and fulfilling your side of our contract. Reluctantly I have decided to pursue a small claims case against Software Marketing Associates, Inc. and the trustees of my 401(k) account.

Jim, thank you for taking the time to point out the “features of our generous 401(k) program”. The appropriate time to point these features out was five years ago during our contract negotiations. With the exception of feature two, these features are irrelevant to the matter at hand. As you were not party to our negotiations it is understandable that you assumed Denise Lunden, in her capacity as President, trustee and primary contract negotiator, disclosed these features and obtained my assent.

As you were able to correctly deduce, I do feel “unfairly” cheated. As my trustees, you took it upon yourselves to be my fiduciary in regards to my 401(k) account. By assuming that role you accepted a legal duty to disclose and obtain assent to all materially relevant facts. Through intentional or unintentional neglect you failed to meet the standard of care of a trustee. The misunderstanding that you were able to perceive was a direct result of the failure of yourself and Denise, as trustees, and Software Marketing Associates, Inc., as an organization, to disclose.

I have spoken to many of my former colleagues, most of whom are still current employees of your organization, and not one of them has supported your position. Every former colleague I have spoken with was not aware of the features of your 401(k) program. Additionally, I have heard that as a result of this breach you have held meetings to finally disclose at least some of this information. Furthermore, I have heard, but have not yet confirmed, that other former employees were given “advances” that were not “recovered”. This is not the description of an organization where transparency and disclosure are practiced.

When deciding to resign my position I relied upon (1) the representation that Denise had made and that I agreed to in September 2007 and (2) the contract that was implied in the regular distribution of my matching contributions and Denise's multiple verbal statements (outlined in my previous email). Had you and Denise performed your duties as trustees, owners, and management by disclosing and obtaining assent to the features of your 401(k) program, I would have adjusted my date of resignation or used my accrued vacation days accordingly. According to my calculations it would have required one additional day of work to meet the “eligibility” requirements Linda Simmons spoke about.

In my final conversation with Denise she told me that you would have preferred me to have given a longer notice before my resignation, despite your “Associate Handbook” asking for between two weeks and “in no event more than four weeks prior” notice. I told her that I was willing to help you in any way possible, which included pushing back my date of resignation. Even at that point Denise failed to disclose that a single day would result in me losing over $5,000, almost half of which was given to me more than six months prior. Nor did she disclose that she would seize funds from my account the next business day.

Finally, as you pointed out in your list of features, your 401(k) matching contributions come from the company's profits. I have not seen your company's financial records, but I am very confident that you and Denise, by way of being shareholders and executive management in charge of the approval of matching contributions, receive direct benefit by my loss. This conflict of interest demanded that you should have taken the utmost care in disclosing material facts, and confirmed to the highest degree possible that such disclosure was unambiguously understood. It is clear based on our present situation that this demand was not satisfied.

While I cannot say you have been very forthcoming at any point in our relationship, you have yet to present a compelling argument. For example, you have so far failed to produce a signed contract stipulating these terms or even a date upon which these terms were first enumerated. I can only assume that your failure to make a pertinent argument is an admission that you are actually unable to do so.


If you have such an argument make it known so that I will not be further wasting my time.


Denise and Jim, if you wish to proceed straight to litigation that is fine. Please let me know so that we can resolve your breaches as quickly as possible. To those ends I require the mailing address of your current residence where you will accept service of court documents. I know you have recently purchased another house; I am unsure where you are living and do not have the address of the newly purchased house.


<strong>Please send me your current address where you will accept service.


If I do not hear from you by September 28th, 2012, I will begin compiling my case against Software Marketing Associates, Inc., for breach of contract, and my trustees, Denise S. Lunden and James A. Lunden, for breach of their fiduciary duty and constructive fraud, seeking compensatory damages, reimbursement of fees and costs, and interest. You can expect to receive my small claims complaint and any other relevant documents shortly thereafter.</strong>

You must arrange a time for me to examine these documents and make me aware of that date and time. I expect you to handle this request as quickly as possible.

I know that you are aware, but apparently it needs to be said again, that you have already passed the 30 day time limit imposed by Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to deliver the documents that I previously requested. I apparently also need to state that under Connecticut law you must give me access to the other documents I am requesting within a “reasonable” amount of time. 

These laws provide for financial penalties for not meeting their standards. You have just about exhausted my leniency.

Below are the documents that I require access to at this time:

1) <strong>ALL</strong> documents governing the 401(k) Plan, including the Adoption Agreement, “basic Plan document #01”, amendments and any others.
2) 401(k) Plan annual reports (Form 5500 Series) and the summary annual report for fiscal years 2011-2012, 2010-2011, 2009-2010, and 2008-2009.
3) My personnel file as discussed in section 202 of the “Associate Handbook” and any other personnel files that I am legally entitled to examine.
4) My medical file as discussed in section 202 of the “Associate Handbook” and any other medical files that I am legally entitled to examine.

<header>I knocked on the door to SMA and Jim Lunden came rushing to the door, appearing in a state of urgency. 

He opened the door and positioned himself inches away from my body and face. I began to tell him that I was there to deliver a physical, hand-signed request to examine Plan documents and also to deliver my COBRA premium check.

Before I was able to say more than a few words, Jim proceeded to yell that he never wanted to see my "fucking face again", asked me if he needed to get a restraining order against me, threatened to "call 911", called 911, and had the responding officer threaten me with arrest if I ever came back to that location.

Prior to the responding officer arriving, I left my documents at the foot of SMA's door and returned to the parking lot. 

I had the responding officer ask Denise and Jim if they would accept my documents, but they refused to accept them. Jim told me to send them to him via certified mail. I sent another copy of my request to Denise via certified mail immediately after being asked to leave by the officer.

Denise:

This is a claim under section 2.10 of the 401 (k) plan of which I am a participant and of which you are the Administrator.

If you are not familiar with the claims procedure of the plan I recommend that you review section 2.10 and 2.11 immediately as it imposes many binding obligations upon yourself.

The Administrator and trustees have violated section 2.4 by failing to disclose in a timely manner, actively and continually misrepresenting, and relying upon this asymmetry of information, to extract a financial benefit for themselves at my expense, of the material terms of the trust, specifically in regard to section 4.1(b)(1), 4.3(b)(4), 10.7(a), 10.7(b), 10.10, 13.3(b)(1), and questions 30.C, 30.F(s) of the Adoption Agreement. The Administrator knew, or reasonably should have known, that because of her failure to disclose, active misrepresentations, and my obvious reliance upon such that I was not aware of and did not understand the content of the above mentioned sections. In fact, the trustee Jim Lunden stated exactly as such in an email to me on July 23, 2012 with the subject line “FW: Breach of Contract”:
	<blockquote>I can understand that based on your misunderstanding of our benefits, you feel that you have been unfairly cheated out of a benefit that you thought you earned.</blockquote>According to at least section 2.4, the Act, and legal theories of fiduciary duty, it was the responsibility of the Administrator and the trustees to make sure that there was no misunderstanding of the benefits and to disclose all material information.

The Administrator and trustees have also violated my rights as described on pages 16 and 17 of the Summary Plan Description that was distributed to me by the Administrator on July 18, 2012. Specifically the trustee Jim Lunden physically prevented me from delivering written notice to examine documents as provided by section (a), (b), and (c) under the title “What are my rights as a Plan participant?”. Furthermore, the Administrator failed to disclose the Plan documents after two written and one verbal request, within the 30 days required by the Act as well as required by the above mentioned document under the above mentioned heading. The Administrator was aware of what documents were requested, and even after additional clarification about which documents were requested failed to deliver them in the time required by the above mentioned document.

Additionally, the Administrator has failed to allow me to examine the Plan's financial reports and summary financial reports for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012.

Additionally, the Administrator did not defer part of my severance compensation under section 3.2(a) of the “Amendment For the Final 415 Regulations” document. This resulted in an injury to my account and resulted in additional income, payroll and potentially other taxes.

This claim also incorporates the claims made in two emails to the Administrator and trustees on July 23, 2012 and September 17, 2012 and which were received by them, by email with the subjects “Breach of contract” and “Re: FW: Breach of contract” respectively. Additionally the contents of the email sent on September 17, 2012 was delivered to the Administrator and Trustees on September 21, 2012 in person and again on September 29, 2012.

In regard to section 2.4 the Administrator and trustees should not only be judged by the criteria set forth by the Plan, the Act, and any other applicable legal theory which their position can be construed to be obligated, but also by the very clear and explicit duties, rules of conduct and ethics that they obligated themselves to in the “Associate Handbook” that the Administrator personally delivered to me in or around February 2012, specifically section 104, whose contents are also incorporated into this claim and which is reproduced in part below:
<blockquote>
	SMA's successful business operation and positive reputation is built upon the principles of fair dealing, legal compliance and ethical conduct by our associates. Our reputation for integrity and excellence requires careful observance of the spirit and letter of all applicable laws and regulations, as well as a scrupulous regard for the highest standards of conduct, ethics and personal integrity.
	
	…
	
	The continued success of SMA is dependent upon our customers' trust and we are dedicated to preserving that trust. Associates owe a duty to SMA and its customers to act in a way that will merit the continued trust and confidence of our customer and the general public.
	
	SMA will comply with all applicable laws and regulations and expects its managers, supervisors, associates and consultants to conduct business and related activities in accordance with the letter, spirit, and intent of all relevant laws and to refrain from any illegal, dishonest, or unethical conduct.
	
	…
	
	Compliance with this policy of business ethics and conduct is the duty and responsibility of every SMA associate. Disregarding or failing to comply with this standard of business ethics and conduct could lead to disciplinary action, up to and including possible termination of employment.
	
	…
	
	Complaints or reports of legal compliance, business conduct, business ethics/integrity or conflict of interest violations or problems or suspected legal compliance, business conduct, business ethics/integrity or conflict of interest violations or problems will be kept confidential to the fullest extent possible, consistent with applicable legal and Company policy limitations and requirements and with the need to conduct a prompt, full, thorough and fair investigation.
	
	Complaints or reports of legal compliance, business conduct, business ethics/integrity or conflict of interest violations or problems will be reviewed and promptly investigated. Appropriate corrective action will be taken if warranted by the investigation.
</blockquote>	
This claim is to make my account whole in accordance with the terms that were represented by the Administrator and trustees as laid out numerous times and which the Administrator and trustees have not contested despite numerous opportunities to do so. This requires restoring the funds that were withdrawn from my account on or around June 18, 2012, including the market gains which have occurred since then as well as payment of the additional matching contributions that were denied to me as a result of the Administrator and trustee's gross negligence and apparently intentional misconduct. This amount is exactly equal to the amount of the two original matching contributions which were removed from my account. Furthermore, this is a claim for the $110/day that the Summary Plan Description referred to above provides for when the above referred to rights were violated. The Plan Documents were requested on July 17, 2012 and the request was not fulfilled until September 28, 2012 a total of 72 days. This is 42 days past the requirement stated in the above mentioned document. The amount of this additional claim is $4,620. Additionally, I am making a claim for the the contributions that were not deferred under section 3.2(a) of the Amendment referred to above. The amount of this additional claim is $204.55.

The actual amount of this claim is $2,670 which is different from the two original matching contributions referred to.

Hi Denise,
I have made contact with Aetna and they have informed me Mr. La Pierre coverage under cobra was reinstated July 1, 2012.  I believe the problem lies in the fact Aetna has the wrong social security number for him. Aetna has his last 6 digits as 06-<strong>[xxxx]</strong>. According to his cobra enrollment form this is incorrect. If he uses his membership number with Aetna he should be able to verify his coverage. His member number is BBQKGQBA. The Aetna representative has stated the social security number in the system has always been the one listed above.
 
Mr La Pierre should contact Aetna directly to correct is social security number on file at Aetna. He may contact me directly if he has any further questions.

Thank you for the information on how Aetna has incorrect information about me. I will contact them to correct that error.

The insurance coverage that my provider was told was terminated is for dental benefits provided by MetLife. My understanding is that these are two separate companies and that contacting Aetna will not fix this problem.

Denise:

COBRA provides for continuation coverage that is exactly the same as the coverage I received while I was an employee of Software Marketing Associates, Inc.

According to the US Department of Labor, medical coverage protected under COBRA includes dental insurance. This is clearly explained in numerous Department of Labor publications, including <a href="http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/cobraemployee.pdf">http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/cobraemployee.pdf</a>, page 3.

Furthermore, at no time did you or anyone else mention to me that you would be dropping my dental insurance. At no time did you or anyone else mention that your definition of medical coverage not include dental insurance. In fact, your definition contradicts the Depart of Labor's definition.

If you are claiming an exemption from COBRA then you need to be much more specific than "the document we gave you uses a different definition of the word medical coverage than what everyone else uses".

Otherwise, you will restore the dental insurance that I have paid for immediately, going back to when the coverage was terminated.

Additionally, I request to examine the Summary Plan Description for the group health plan as well as to examine all of the plan documents. Contact me as soon as you have arranged a time for me to examine these documents.

Finally, this email chain is incorporated into my section 2.10 claim against the 401 (k) trust of which you are the administrator. This is a further example of how you misrepresent material information to the injury of your own beneficiaries.

Denise:

I received your three pound package today. As you pointed out in your notice, you had previously sent me almost all of those documents after I had explicitly requested them. Sending duplicates was unnecessary.

Regarding your determination, it is disappointing, but ultimately completely unsurprising that you failed to address my specific claims/complaints. Rather, the notice seems to just be a regurgitation of what Linda, Jim, and the documents you sent me already conveyed and to which I submitted a very direct, logical, and compelling argument against. You failed to address that argument. You also failed to acknowledge or address my other claims, specifically regarding your failure to provide documents in the time prescribed by the trust and your failure to defer part of my severance as provided by the trust.

At the end of your notice you told me to email you if I have questions regarding the Claims Review Procedure. I do:

1) How much prior notice will you be giving me and/or my representation regarding the time and location of the hearing?
2) How much prior notice will you require to assemble the documents I will be requesting to review at the hearing?
3) What documents are in your possession for me to review that you have not already provided copies of?
4) How much time will be given to me to present my evidence?
5) Will you provide a neutral third party to moderate the hearing? In my experience dealing with you and Jim you have a tendency to talk over, yell at and curse at me. With these facts in mind, it is necessary to have a neutral moderator to ensure a fair hearing.
6) Will you provide a neutral third party that can help to determine relevant facts, irrelevant facts and logical arguments that must be rebutted?
7) Will you provide the video and audio recording of the hearing or shall I? I will probably want to bring my own devices for the recording anyway.
8) Are you again requiring me to submit my request to move to the Claims Review Procedure as certified mail? Or will email suffice?


I may have more questions in the coming days. I will email you should the need arise.

The US Department of Labor is extremely clear on what COBRA applies to. I suggest you see for yourself: http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq_compliance_cobra.htm 
<strong style="font-size:0.8em">[US DOL has since changed this to <a href="http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq-consumer-cobra.html">http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq-consumer-cobra.html</a>]</strong>

It is demonstrably true that SMA falls into a business that is bound by COBRA. SMA employed at least 20 full time employees or their part time equivalent. If you believe this to be false, I suggest you count them yourself. It is irrelevant whether or not an employee was eligible for coverage. 


Regarding my dental coverage, I since come under coverage by a separate policy so there will be no need to reinstate me under your policy. 

However, I have attached a scan of my dental bill, only a portion of which you should be responsible for. You should have offered me continuation of my dental coverage under COBRA, but you did not. At the very least, for reasons pointed out previously, you should have informed me that you would be dropping my coverage. Because of this negligence, and especially because all evidence points to hostile motives, I believe most standards of fairness require you to reimburse me for this expense. If you wish, you can subtract off the amount that I would have paid in premiums and administrative fees to keep my dental coverage up to this month.

I believe the amount you are responsible for is: $216.00

This is the amount my dentist's office claims I have to pay because of my policy being canceled. This is the sum of the line items 3, 4, and 5 added to the result of the credit on line 6 added to line 2, which was paid for fully by line 6.


Regarding your explicit declaration that you will not respond to questions by email: in your one personal response to this situation, which was only a few days ago, you specifically asked me to email you any questions I had.

I do not believe I will have any more questions for you; you have made it extremely clear that you are unwilling or unable to have any kind of dialog that could be described as mature or rational.

This is an electronic version. As you demanded, someone will deliver a physical copy to you.

Denise:

This is notice under Section 2.11 of the 401 (k) Plan for Software Marketing Associates, Inc. of my request to move to the “Claims Review Procedure”.

The reasons for this request are simple:

	1) You broke our contract
	2) You have not contested the terms of our contract
	3) You have provided no alternative explanation of the facts

Your strategies are simple, apparent, and childish:

	1) Ignore facts, logic, and reality
	2) Propagate misinformation
	3) Deflect arguments by generating irrelevant information
	4) Ignore any arguments presented to you for which you are unable to generate irrelevant information

The undisputed facts are:

	1) You did not accurately reveal the contents of the trust documents
	2) All of your verbal statements up to June 15th 2012 directly contradict the contents of the trust documents
	3) You did not reveal to me that you would remove funds from my account
	4) You did not reveal to me that you did remove funds from my account
	5) Your only argument so far has been to assert the authority of documents first brought to my attention fully one month after my last day of employment
	6) You failed to produce documents in the manner to which you are bound by the trust and by law

You have not disputed one of these facts. Every time I have brought them to your attention you have ignored them.

Every attempt I have made to solicit an alternative explanation from you has been met with:

	1) You hanging up the phone on myself and Jodi
	2) You having Eric escort me off of your floor with no explanation
	3) You failing to provide me with documents in a way that you are contractually and legally bound to
	4) Jim telling me he was disappointed I would be unable to help him with “work he paid me to perform”
	5) You refusing to tell me if and how I could appeal your unilateral decision to remove assets from my account
	6) Jim refusing to accept my COBRA payment
	7) You refusing to accept my COBRA payment
	8) Jim refusing to accept a request to examine documents that I am contractually and legally entitled to examine
	9) You refusing to accept a request to examine documents I am contractually and legally entitled to examine
	10) Jim telling me he never wants to “see my fucking face again”
	11) Jim threatening to get a restraining order against me
	12) Jim threatening to “call 911”
	13) Jim calling “911”
	14) Jim telling me that the documents I was trying to give you must be sent via certified mail, despite him standing less than one foot away from me
	15) You standing behind the door, acting oblivious, while I tried to submit my COBRA payment and written request to examine documents
	16) You continuing to act oblivious while I knocked on the door and told you I had documents for you
	17) A police officer questioning whether I brought weapons to your place of business
	18) You having a police officer threaten me with arrest
	19) You and Jim telling me to sue you in Federal court

Furthermore:

	1) Your decision about my claim failed to address two (2) of the four (4) claims made
	2) You explicitly asked me to email you questions about the review procedure; when I emailed you my questions, you immediately responded by sending me a letter via UPS explaining that you will not answer any questions by email and that I must package them and then pay someone else to deliver them to you
	3) You did not tell me you were canceling my dental insurance, despite my electing and paying to continue all medical benefits under COBRA
	4) You continue to claim that SMA is not subject to COBRA despite this being demonstrably false, and even after me presenting you with the requirements of COBRA
	5) You have not reimbursed me for medical expenses I incurred due to your actions described in 3) & 4) above

At the hearing I will present old and new damning evidence and arguments that prove beyond any doubt that you have misrepresented facts, abused your powers as Administrator and Trustee, and acted maliciously in a way that enriched yourself, Jim, and the other shareholder of SMA at my expense.

I will also deconstruct the arguments you have so far put forth. Additionally, I will deconstruct many of the other “communications” that you and Jim have sent me. I will show that they are:

	1) Irrelevant
	2) In bad faith
	3) Wrought with logical, legal, and ethical fallacies

I have reproduced or paraphrased some of your responsibilities and powers according to the trust:
	
	Section 2.4
	1) Your primary responsibility is to act for my “exclusive benefit”
	2) You have the power to construe the terms of the plan in any way you want
	3) You are allowed to determine whether or not I am entitled to benefits
	4) You may “correct any defect, supply any information, or reconcile any inconsistency in such manner and to such extent as shall be deemed necessary or advisable to carry out the purpose of the Plan” provided you do so in a nondiscriminatory manner
	5) Further enumerated duties:
		a) The discretion to determine all questions relating to the eligibility of an Employee to participate or remain a Participant hereunder and to receive benefits under the Plan
		b) The authority to review and settle all claims against the Plan, including claims where the settlement amount cannot be calculated or is not calculated in accordance with the Plan's benefit formula. This authority specifically permits the Administrator to settle disputed claims for benefits and any other disputed claims made against the the Plan
		c) To compute, certify, and direct the Trustee with respect to the amount and the kind of benefits to which any Participant shall be entitled hereunder
		d) To maintain all necessary records for the administration of the Plan
		e) To interpret the plan and to make and publish rules that are consistent with the contents of the trust documents
		f) To assist Participants regarding their rights, benefits, or elections available under the Plan

The wording of Section 2.4 is very specific and you are bound even tighter than my paraphrasing implies. I have included a complete copy of Section 2 with this notice.

You claimed that “there is nothing you can do” to return the assets to my account. I immediately called this out for what it is: bullshit. You told me, “Blake, it is not bullshit.” Denise, Section 2.4 is very clear that your claim is, in fact, bullshit.

Additionally, Section 2.1(d), “Review of fiduciary performance”, requires:

The Employer shall periodically review the performance of any Fiduciary or other person to whom duties have been delegated or allocated by it under the provisions of this Plan or pursuant to procedures established hereunder. This requirement may be satisfied by formal periodic review by the Employer or by a qualified person specifically designated by the Employer, through day-to-day conduct and evaluation or through other appropriate ways.


It is apparent that you are uniquely unqualified to conduct our hearing or to decide the outcome of my appeal because of an undeniable conflict of interest. The bases of my claim were:

	1) You extracted a financial benefit at my expense as Owner of SMA
	2) As my fiduciary you bound yourself to act solely in my interest
	3) You withheld material information and actively misrepresented the contents of the trust documents
	4) You actively misrepresented the nature of the company's 401 (k) match
	5) You did not tell me you were going to withdraw shares from my account
	6) You did not tell me you did withdraw shares from my account
	7) You broke your fiduciary obligation to me by taking the above actions
	8) You became legally liable for all damages by breaking your obligations

You already had a conflict of interest when deciding the outcome of my claim. You now face additional conflicts of interest:

	1) You get to decide the outcome of my appeal
	2) You decided on the claim my appeal is about
	3) You personally benefited by denying my claim
	4) You will personally benefit by denying my appeal
	5) You personally benefited from your actions to which the claim pertained
	6) You have not disputed that you broke your obligations, nor have you put forth an alternative explanation of the facts
	7) Your decision on my appeal did not address a single complaint that I raised

In order to have a fair hearing I believe that the following conditions must be met:

	1) The hearing must be public
	2) Employees, Participants, and Beneficiaries must be invited to attend
	3) You must appoint a neutral party to moderate
	4) You must appoint a neutral party to make a binding decision as to each of the claims
	5) In addition to the arguments I have and will present, you must also be allowed to present an alternative explanation of the facts

You are in control of over $3,000,000 of employee and former employee assets. Your behavior in regard to your duties is deplorable. Every beneficiary has an interest in the outcome of this hearing, as the charges made against you are a direct assault on your ability to execute the trust in a manner that is “for the exclusive benefit of the Participants and their Beneficiaries”, as required by the trust in Section 2.4, as well as in the manner that is required by common and U.S. Federal law. As such, all Participants known to me have been sent a copy of this notice.

If you do not agree to these conditions, or fail to suggest other conditions that could be considered fair, it will represent the culmination of the failure of you and your organization to act:

	1) Prudently
	2) Upon a principle of fair dealing (“Associate Handbook” Section 104)
	3) Upon a principle of legal compliance (Section 104)
	4) Upon a principle of ethical conduct (Section 104)
	5) In accordance with your “reputation for integrity and excellence” (Section 104)
	6) With observance to the “spirit and letter of all applicable laws and regulations” (Section 104)
	7) With a “scrupulous regard for the highest standards of conduct, ethics, and personal integrity” (Section 104)
	8) With the “use of good judgment” (Section 104)
	9) “Based on high ethical principals” (Section 104)

By your own admission, this would destroy the foundation that “SMA's successful business operation and positive reputation is built upon” (Section 104).

The evidence already strongly suggests that the Business Ethics and Conduct (Section 104 of the “Associate Handbook”) you disseminated are solely intended to create the illusion of propriety. By not agreeing to a hearing with the conditions enumerated above, you will again confirm everything that has been suspected of you.

Every benefit of the doubt has been afforded to you. Until you provide a logical argument that can explain all of the facts that have been presented to you over the last several months, there is no more doubt as to the wrongness of your actions and your motivations.

As provided for by Section 2.11, the documents I will examine at the hearing are:

	1) Your “written acceptance” (Section 2.2) in which you signify that you accept the responsibilities, obligations, and liabilities imposed by the trust and for which you were specifically appointed by Section 2.1(a) for the sole purpose of “ensur[ing] that the Plan is being operated for the exclusive benefit of the Participants and their Beneficiaries in accordance with the terms of the Plan, the Code, and the Act”

	2) Company and trust financial documents for at least the FY 2007-2012, showing any and all benefits, financial or otherwise, paid to, or received by, you or the other Shareholders or Trustees

	3) Company and trust financial documents that show, for every employee who was not employed on June 30th of any fiscal year in which they were employed on other days of that year, whether or not “advance” payments, “gateway” payments, or other contributions were:
	
			a) Made to that employee's account
			b) Removed from that employee's account
		
		The former employees whom I know fit the previous description are:
		
			a) Jake Rotunno
			b) Stephen Holman 
			c) Dimitry Matusevich 
			d) Deneece Brown 
			e) Damian Currier

	4) All documents regarding the reviews, or lack thereof, of the performance of the trust Fiduciaries, including describing their methodology, results and analysis (Section 2.1(d)), since the establishment of the trust

	5) The full annual reports of the Trustee (Section 7.9) for at least FY 2007 – 2012

	6) All of the documents referred to in Section 2.5 “Records and Reports”

	7) All other trust documents for at least the years I was employed that are in your possession as provided for in Section 2.11

If you believe any of these documents are not “pertinent to the claim at issue” (Section 2.11), you must dispute them prior to the hearing so that I can provided you with further, piercing, analysis for why each of these documents is pertinent to my claims.

If I receive a copy of these documents prior to the hearing it will greatly speed the hearing up. Contact me first if there are going to be any fees associated with receiving a copy of these documents prior to the hearing.

P.S. Please advise your husband to avoid our hearing if he still does not want to see my “fucking face”.

This is an electronic version. As you have previously demanded, someone else will deliver a physical copy of this document to you at my expense.

Denise:

I have received your letter dated January 15, 2013, titled “Claims Review Hearing”.

In it you continue your tired strategies of:

	1. Ignoring facts, logic, and reality
	2. Propagating misinformation
	3. Deflecting arguments by generating irrelevant information
	4. Ignoring any arguments presented to you for which you are unable to generate irrelevant information

We will now examine this in detail.

In a letter you sent to me on November 15, 2012, titled “Claims Review Procedure” you stated:
	<blockquote>We will conduct a hearing within thirty days of receiving your claim for review. We will notify you of the hearing date and time as soon as it is scheduled, but in any event, no later than two weeks prior to the hearing date.</blockquote><strong>Our hearing cannot be held on January 28, 2013.</strong> You notified me of the hearing date on January 16, 2013. This makes the earliest valid hearing date January 31, 2013. You have proposed an invalid hearing date. <strong>As of this writing, no valid hearing has been scheduled. You must propose a valid hearing date.</strong> Based on your reliance of UPS “adult signature required” services and the time it would take you to notify me of the new date, <strong>the earliest possible valid hearing date you can now propose is February 6, 2013</strong>. According to the trust, <strong>you must hold our hearing on or before February 19, 2013.</strong>

Even with your proposed invalid hearing date, you had already passed your self-imposed 30-day time limit to hold our hearing and are rapidly approaching the 60-day limit imposed by the trust.

In your letter received on January 16, 2013, you state:
	<blockquote>Each of the hearing “conditions” specified in your December 20, 2012 email is denied. In other words: (1) the hearing will not be public; (2) employees, participants and beneficiaries will not be invited to attend, nor will they be permitted to attend; (3) SMA will appoint an appropriate person to conduct the hearing; (4) SMA will render a decision on the claim; and (5) SMA will not be obligated to make any presentation during the hearing whatsoever.</blockquote>You have not disputed my assertion that a fair hearing must meet my conditions. This can only be interpreted to mean that you intend to hold an unfair, and apparently an absurdly, Kafka-esque, hearing in direct contradiction to your notorious “Business Ethics and Conduct”. <strong>This is unacceptable behavior for anyone, let alone a President/CEO/Owner who is also the Administrator of a company's 401 (k), who is being correctly challenged on her ability to execute the trust for the “exclusive benefit” of the Participants. This is unacceptable behavior under your own standards, which you freely published in February 2012.</strong>

Furthermore, you assert that SMA has authority to appoint a moderator or render a decision. <strong>It does not have that authority.</strong> Section 2.11 is very clear that <strong>only the Administrator</strong> (in case you have forgotten, this is yourself) <strong>can conduct the hearing or render a decision.</strong> If you are explicitly delegating this authority to SMA, which I can only assume is code for yourself, <strong>it is unacceptable</strong>. As I very clearly laid out in my Section 2.11 request, <strong>you have multiple conflicts of interest that prevent you from conducting anything that could even remotely resemble a hearing. You have not disputed these conflicts of interest.</strong>

In your letter received on January 16, 2013, you go on to state:
	<blockquote>However, the documents that you have asked to review are not pertinent to your claim for benefits.</blockquote>You have merely <strong>asserted</strong> your <strong>unsubstantiated opinion</strong> as <strong>fact</strong>.

You then go on to state:
	<blockquote>The only additional document, which may be pertinent to your claim is SMA's Form 5500 Annual return / Report of Employee Benefit Plan (“Form 5500”), which we anticipate will be filed by the end of this week.</blockquote>It would be fascinating to know why you believe this document, which, based on my examination of previous years' Form 5500, contains no pertinent information whatsoever, is somehow pertinent to my claim, if it weren't <strong>blindingly obvious</strong> that this is a complete bullshit sentence that you have deployed as part of your simple, apparent, and childish strategies (see items 2) and 3) in the second list in my Section 2.11 notice to you, and reproduced at the top of this letter):
	<blockquote>2. Propagate misinformation
3. Deflect arguments by generating irrelevant information</blockquote>As promised, I will now demonstrate to you why each document I requested is extremely “pertinent to [my] claim for benefits”:
	<blockquote>1. Your “written acceptance” (Section 2.2) in which you signify that you accept the responsibilities, obligations, and liabilities imposed by the trust and for which you were specifically appointed by Section 2.1(a) for the sole purpose of “ensur[ing] that the Plan is being operated for the exclusive benefit of the Participants and their Beneficiaries in accordance with the terms of the Plan, the Code, and the Act”</blockquote><strong>This document establishes that you personally obligated yourself to me as a Participant (Section 2.4) by accepting all duties, obligations, responsibilities and liabilities imposed by the trust. It establishes that you accepted full financial liability to me for any losses caused by you. As I have pointed out more times than should be necessary, THE PRIMARY BASIS OF MY CLAIM IS THAT YOU HAVE FAILED TO ACT “FOR THE EXCLUSIVE BENEFIT OF THE PARTICIPANTS AND THEIR BENEFICIARIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE PLAN, THE CODE, AND THE ACT”. You must explain how this is not pertinent.</strong>
	
	
	<blockquote>2. Company and trust financial documents for at least the FY 2007-2012, showing any and all benefits, financial or otherwise, paid to, or received by, you or the other Shareholders or Trustees</blockquote><strong>These documents establish that you have, or reasonably expect to, extract a personal financial benefit that is directly proportional to the losses I suffered as a result of your actions, and is, in fact, exactly those losses that I suffered. This is forbidden by Section 2.4 of the trust, the Act, and every legal and ethical theory of fiduciary duty. You must explain how this is not pertinent.</strong>

<blockquote>
Company and trust financial documents that show, for every employee who was not employed on June 30th of any fiscal year in which they were employed on other days of that year, whether or not “advance” payments, “gateway” payments, or other contributions were:

                    a) Made to that employee's account
                    b) Removed from that employee's account
					
       The former employees whom I know fit the previous description are:
	   
                    a) Jake Rotunno
                    b) Stephen Holman
                    c) Dimitry Matusevich
                    d) Deneece Brown
                    e) Damian Currier</blockquote><strong>THESE DOCUMENTS CONSTITUTE CORE EVIDENCE FOR MY CLAIM. THEY CANNOT BE DENIED. They will be used in an argument, that you will be unable to dispute, that your initial actions, which all of my claims are about, violated Section 2.4 Sentence 4:
	<blockquote>The Administrator may establish procedures, correct any defect, supply any information, or reconcile any inconsistency in such manner and to such extent as shall be deemed necessary or advisable to carry out the purpose of the Plan; PROVIDED, HOWEVER THAT ANY PROCEDURE, DISCRETIONARY ACT, INTERPRETATION OR CONSTRUCTION SHALL BE DONE IN A NONDISCRIMINATORY MANNER BASED UPON UNIFORM PRINCIPLES CONSISTENTLY APPLIED and shall be consistent with the intent that the Plan continue to be deemed a qualified plan under the terms of Code Section 401(a), and shall comply with the terms of the Act and all regulations issued pursuant thereto.

(emphasis mine)</blockquote>Allegations have been made by one or more persons on that list that the actions you took against me were not taken against them. I have made you aware of these allegations on multiple occasions. You have not denied these allegations. Your assertion that these documents are not “pertinent to [my] claim for benefits” is ABSURD. It has absolutely no basis in reality. You must explain how this is not pertinent.</strong>

	
	<blockquote>3. All documents regarding the reviews, or lack thereof, of the performance of the trust Fiduciaries, including describing their methodology, results and analysis (Section 2.1(d)), since the establishment of the trust</blockquote><strong>These documents will likely be used as supporting evidence for my argument that you do not take your duties, responsibilities, and obligations seriously. While you have already provided me with ample evidence during your completely incompetent handling of this situation, I believe there is likely more evidence. I will not know until I see these documents. This is expert testimony relating directly to one of the primary bases of my claim. You must explain how this is not pertinent.</strong>

	
	<blockquote>5. The full annual reports of the Trustee (Section 7.9) for at least FY 2007 – 2012</blockquote><strong>These documents will support the documents requested in item 3) above. They may provide further evidence of you acting in a discriminatory manner which is specifically forbid in Section 2.4. You must explain how this is not pertinent.</strong>

	
	<blockquote>6. All of the documents referred to in Section 2.5 “Records and Reports”</blockquote><strong>Again, these documents likely provide further evidence in the same vein as the documents in item 3) and 5). You must explain how this is not pertinent.</strong>
    
	
	<blockquote>7. All other trust documents for at least the years I was employed that are in your possession as provided for in Section 2.11</blockquote><strong>Every document you have in your possession is pertinent to my claim. As was plainly stated when I requested these documents: MY CLAIMS ARE A DIRECT ASSAULT ON YOUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE THE TRUST. IT IS UNKNOWN HOW MUCH YOU HAVE ABUSED YOUR POSITION AND HOW MUCH EVIDENCE THAT SUPPORTS MY CLAIM EXISTS. THE ONLY WAY FOR ME TO OBTAIN THIS EVIDENCE IS FOR ME TO EXAMINE THE DOCUMENTS. You must explain how this is not pertinent.</strong>

If you continue to believe that any of these documents are “not pertinent to [my] claim for benefits” <strong>you must show, for each document, WHY the document is “not pertinent”</strong>. Your simple assertion that these documents are “not pertinent to [my] claim for benefits” is insufficient, especially given that <strong>almost every assertion you have made to me since my resignation has been demonstrably false</strong>. If you continue to challenge the pertinence of these documents you must do so prior to our hearing, affording me enough time to respond. Otherwise, I will examine these documents at our hearing.

It appears that it requires repeating, in your November 15, 2012 letter titled “Claims Review Procedure” <strong>you stated</strong>, “We will notify you of the hearing date and time as soon as it is scheduled, but <strong>in any event, no later than two weeks prior to the hearing date</strong>.” As of this writing, <strong>no valid hearing has been scheduled</strong>. I will expect your notification shortly.

I am rapidly growing weary of your games. If you believe you are right, then present an argument. You have been given ample opportunity to do so. At every occasion you have declined. I will continue to call you out on it until you do so. Your bullshit tactics fool no one, save, perhaps Jim, although I seriously doubt that even he falls for it.

Your current behavior is utterly inconsistent with the “Business Ethics and Conduct” which you have proclaimed as your own. Your continuous defiance of them has only created an extensive body of evidence to support the very claims I have been making all along.

You may continue to run roughshod over our situation at your own peril.

Denise:

Yesterday I received your letter in which you state that you received my “communication”.

At least you took the time to edit the first paragraph to state that Suite 102 is on the First Floor; I suppose you did forgot that part in your last communication. I also saw that you have now chosen to video record the hearing, just as I informed you I would be doing months ago. Your move towards some transparency receives my applause.

You received my communication and as usual you are attempting to ignore it. Unsurprising, as this was previously identified as your primary strategy.

<strong>You have so far failed to propose a hearing as required by Section 2.11</strong> of the Boston Financial Data Services Defined Contribution Prototype Plan and Trust (the “Prototype Plan”).

As set forth in the Prototype Plan, Section 2.11, Sentence 4:
	<blockquote>At the hearing, <strong>the claimant or the claimant's representative shall have an opportunity to review all documents in the possession of the Administrator which are pertinent to the claim at issue and its disallowance.</strong></blockquote>I have submitted a written request to examine documents at the hearing, pursuant to your November 15, 2012 communication titled “Claims Review Procedure”:
	<blockquote>If you intend to request additional documents for review prior to the hearing, we must receive your written request no later than one week prior to the hearing date.</blockquote>In your communication, received January 16, 2013, you proposed to hold a hearing on a date in violation of the Prototype Plan. In this ill-formed proposal you asserted:
	<blockquote><strong>“the documents that you have asked to review are not pertinent to your claim for benefits”</strong></blockquote>On January 17, 2013, you received a communication from me pointing out that your proposed hearing date was not pursuant to Section 2.11 and revealing your continued lack of regard for your duties, responsibilities, obligations, and communications. In that communication, I also established pertinence for each document that I have requested.

On January 21, 2013, I received a communication from you that attempted to correct the errors that existed in its prior incarnation. <strong>In this communication, the established pertinence of the requested documents was not challenged, yet you indicated that the requested documents would not be available at your proposed hearing</strong>. In fact, this communication <strong>appears to be an exact duplicate</strong> of your January 16, 2013 communication with minor changes made to dates, an added reference to “First Floor”, and an unanticipated indication that you have discarded audio recording technology for video.

<strong>The hearing you have proposed for February 11, 2013 is not pursuant to Section 2.11 or your November 15, 2013 communication titled “Claims Review Procedure”. Again, Section 2.11, Sentence 4 of the Prototype Plan states:</strong>
	<blockquote><strong>At the hearing, the claimant or the claimant's representative shall have an opportunity to review all documents in the possession of the Administrator which are pertinent to the claim at issue and its disallowance.</strong></blockquote>I realize that you have not been preparing these documents for my examination over the last thirty-two (32) days, but <strong>the Prototype Plan compels you to hold a hearing, pursuant to Section 2.11, on or before February 19, 2013</strong>.

If you would like to have a personal conversation with me at that time, I may be in the area on unrelated business. At this time I am unaware of any scheduled Section 2.11 hearings; please refer to my previous communications.

I was told by the police officer that your husband called in September that you may have me arrested if I return to your premises. I am not interested in being arrested, so if you'd like me to come to your office I will need a written statement from you and your husband declaring that I am allowed on or near your premises and that you will not have me arrested.

Blake,

 

Again, the hearing you requested has been rescheduled for February 13 at 10:00.  The hearing is to be held in Suite 102 not in Software Marketing's office (Software Marketing is in Suite 200) so you will not be arrested for attending the hearing in the designated location.  I do not wish to have a personal conversation with you.

 

If you plan on attending the hearing let me know.

Denise:

You continue to make false statements:

        >  At this time you have received all documents that are available to you for your review.
 

I have not received one of the Form 5500 documents that I requested in September. You told me I would receive this document "in advance of the hearing on February 11, 2013".

Today is February 12, 2013 and I have not received this document, nor have I received any of the documents I requested in my December 20, 2012 communication.


You continue to ask me a question that I have already answered. I, again, refer you to my previous communications.

I thought my previous communications were very clear, but I will be even more explicit for you:

I will not be at 1086 Elm Street, Suite 102 (not in Software Marketing's office (Software Marketing is in Suite 200)), First Floor, Rocky Hill, CT 06067 on February 13, 2013 at "10:00". There is absolutely no reason for me to be there. You continue to insist that I be there, but you have said that you do not want to have a conversation with me, and you are not holding a Section 2.11 hearing. 

Of all the places I could be tomorrow morning, why would I be at that location? I won't.


Sometime after February 19, 2013 I will be filing a complaint with the US Department of Labor, Employee Benefits Security Administration. In the complaint I will detail your violations of the Plan, ERISA, and COBRA. Depending on the outcome of their investigation, we may hold the Section 2.11 hearing at a later date. The Plan compels you to produce the documents I requested, you do not have a choice, and I will "have an opportunity to review" them.

You may review the EBSA's enforcement abilities here: <a href="http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/erisa_enforcement.html">http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/erisa_enforcement.html</a>


If you do not understand any part of the above, please send me your specific questions so that I can clarify.

The following email will be sent after this Complaint has been submitted, the links are for the purposes of this Complaint and are not part of the original communication:
</blockquote>
<header>From:	Blake La Pierre
To:		SMA 401k Participants, Denise Lunden
Subject:	To The SMA 401k Participants and Administrator
</header>
<blockquote class="blake final">
Participants of SMA's 401(k) Plan,


I apologize for having to continue to contact you in this capacity.


The Administrator and Trustee of our 401(k) Plan and Group Health Plan has, at the very least:
	
	1) Extracted a personal financial benefit for herself and her husband, the co-Trustee, at the direct expense of a participant

	2) Discriminately invoked clauses in the 401(k) Plan to achieve her personal financial benefit

	3) Misrepresented and withheld material terms of the 401(k) Plan to achieve and maintain her personal financial benefit

	4) Refused to execute the administrative claims procedure of the 401(k) Plan to maintain her personal financial benefit

	5) Refused to provide access to 401(k) Plan and group health plan documents

	6) Denied benefits guaranteed under COBRA

	7) Refused to provide instructions on how to file an administrative claim against the group health plan

Substantial and overwhelming evidence of these allegations has been collected, documented, and brought to the Administrator's attention.

The Administrator refuses to act on or dispute this evidence or the allegations they support.

A Complaint has been filed with the US Department of Labor, Employee Benefits Security Administration. This agency claims the authority to retrieve the documents that have been requested, to enforce the terms of the Plan and to take other actions, including civil and criminal investigations.

The full Complaint is available at: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/162863718/SMAComplaint/Complaint.html

Please feel free to contact me if you think I may be able to assist you in a dispute with Denise, or for any other matter.




Denise,

I have received your final decision.

I have tried many different approaches to communicate with you. New approaches will now be attempted.


First, we will try your approach to communication. 

This evaluation of your actions is based upon the following documents, most of which you invoked and/or authored and some of which were communicated to you previously: <a href="Evidence/BusinessEthicsAndConduct.pdf">Associate Handbook For Associates of: Software Marketing Associates, Inc.</a> (the "Associate Handbook"); <a href="Evidence/SMA 401k - Section 2.pdf">Boston Financial Data Services Defined Contribution Prototype Plan and Trust</a> (the "Prototype Plan"); <a href="Evidence/Software Marketing AA.pdf">Adoption Agreement for Boston Financial Data Services Non-Standardized 401(K) Profit Sharing Plan</a> (the "Adoption Agreement"); <a href="Evidence/Software Marketing.sum.pdf">Software Marketing Associates Inc. 401(K) Plan Summary Plan Description</a> (the "Summary Plan Description"); <a href="#November2">RE: Notice of Adverse Benefit Determination</a> (the "Adverse Determination"); <a href="#November17">RE: Claims Review Procedure</a> (the "Claims Review Procedure Communication"); <a href="#November2">Re: RE: Notice of Adverse Benefit Determination</a> (the "Response to Adverse Determination"); <a href="#December20">SMA 401 (k) Section 2.11 Notice</a> (the "Section 2.11 Notice"); <a href="#January16">"RE: Claims Review Hearing" Dated January 15, 2013</a> and <a href="#January21">"RE: Claims Review Hearing" Dated January 18, 2013</a> (collectively, the "Claims Review Hearing Communications"); and <a href="#February15">"RE: Claim for Benefits; Final Decision"</a> (the "Final Decision"). 

The Administrator is required to “conduct a hearing” where I "have an opportunity to review all documents in the possession of the Administrator". See Prototype Plan at ¶ 2.11 (Claims Review Procedure). See Summary Plan Description at page 15 & 16 (Article XI Protected Benefits and Claims Procedures, What is the Claims Review Procedure?).

The hearing is required to be conducted "within thirty days" of your receipt of my request; in your case, before January 20, 2013. See Claims Review Procedure Communication. 

The original Claims Review Procedure allowed more time. According to the original specifications, the hearing is required to be conducted "within the next sixty (60) days" of your receipt; in your case, before February 19, 2013. See Prototype Plan at ¶ 2.11 (Claims Review Procedure).

A hearing has not been conducted. See Final Decision.

The Final Decision cited Prototype Plan at ¶ 4.3 for the claim, "In order to share in the matching contribution for a Plan Year, a Participant must be employed on the last day of the Plan Year". ¶ 4.3 is spread over eight pages of very dense technical language that covers many not pertinent and disparate concepts such as "separate accounting", "highly compensated employees", "gateway contributions", "gains or losses", "contracts", "Top-Heavy Plan Years", "other plans", "delay in processing transactions", "410(b) ratio percentage fail-safe provisions", and on. See Final Decision. See Prototype Plan at ¶ 4.3. 

A final decision must "set forth" a number of things, including, "[r]eference to the specific Plan provisions on which the benefit determination is based". See Summary Plan Description at page 16 (Article XI Protected Benefits and Claims Procedures). "[The final decision] communication shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and shall include specific reasons for the decision and specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based". See Prototype Plan at ¶ 2.11 (Claims Review Procedure). You cited a not specific, not pertinent, one-tenth of the seventy-nine pages of the Prototype Plan as evidence for the core claim of your entire argument. Based on the foregoing, the Final Decision does not form an understandable communication as required.

My complaints possess "the need to conduct a prompt, full, thorough and fair investigation". My complaints will "be reviewed and promptly investigated". See Associate Handbook at Section 104 (Business Ethics and Conduct).

No prompt, full, thorough or fair investigation has occurred. See Adverse Determination. See Section 2.11 Notice. See Claims Review Hearing Communications. See Final Decision.

A final decision must be given a "full and fair review", that "take[s] into account all comments, documents, records, and other information submitted by [me] relating to [my] claim". See Summary Plan Description at page 15 (Article XI Protected Benefits and Claims Procedures, What is the Claims Review Procedure?).

Because the Final Decision is almost completely an exact duplicate of the Adverse Determination, it did not take into account any comments, documents, records or other information relating to my claims, which I have submitted, at least since the Adverse Determination was set forth on October 31, 2012. The comments, documents, records or other information which I have submitted are substantial, yet it was simply proved that none of them were taken into account. See Adverse Determination. See Final Decision.

Because the Final Decision is almost completely an exact duplicate of the Adverse Determination, it also suffers from the exact same deficits as the Adverse Determination. These deficits were previously described to you, and include the Adverse Determination, and consequently the Final Decision, not making a decision on two of my four claims. See Adverse Determination. See Final Decision. See Response to Adverse Determination.

"SMA will comply with all applicable laws and regulations and expects its managers, supervisors, associates and consultants to conduct business and related activities in accordance with the letter, spirit, and intent of all relevant laws and to refrain from any illegal, dishonest, or unethical conduct". See Associate Handbook at Section 104 (Business Ethics and Conduct).

"SMA's policies, work rules, practices and procedures are intended to serve as a basis for ethical and lawful decision making and sound judgment in the conduct of all work-related activities." See Associate Handbook at Section 104 (Business Ethics and Conduct).

"Compliance with this policy of business ethics and conduct is the duty and responsibility of every SMA associate. Disregarding or failing to comply with this standard of business ethics and conduct could lead to disciplinary action, up to and including possible termination of employment." See Associate Handbook at Section 104 (Business Ethics and Conduct).

Associates must report any "business conduct, practice, ethics and/or integrity problem or issue" and any "actual, possible or potential conflict of interest" or any "actual, possible or potential unethical, dishonest or illegal conduct or behavior" that they are "involved in or become aware of". Associates must also make a report when they, "in good faith, suspect such violations, problems, issues, conflicts or behaviors have occurred or exist". These reports must be made to "an appropriate Company representative (including the President)". See Associate Handbook at Section 104 (Business Ethics and Conduct).

"An associate or other SMA official or representative who harasses, threatens, punishes, disciplines or otherwise retaliates against someone because that person has in good faith (1) reported a legal compliance, business conduct, business ethics/integrity or conflict of interest violation or problem or a suspected legal compliance, business conduct, business ethics/integrity or conflict of interest violation or problem, (2) complied with SMA's business ethics and conduct policy, (3) acted as a witness in a matter concerning or involving SMA's business ethics and conduct policy or (4) participated in an investigation conducted in connection with SMA's business ethics and conduct policy, is subject to discipline up to and including termination of employment." See Associate Handbook at Section 104 (Business Ethics and Conduct).

I have been, at the very least, harassed, threatened and retaliated against by either you or Jim after (1) reporting actual, possible, potential and/or suspected legal compliance, business conduct, business ethics/integrity and conflict of interest violations and problems, (2) complying with SMA's Business Ethics and Conduct policy and (3) acting as a witness in a matter concerning or involving SMA's business ethics and conduct policy. I have been unable to think of a plausible motivation for your actions beyond those mentioned in the foregoing paragraph. Jim has not revealed the motivations for his harassment, threats or retaliations against me. You have not revealed the motivations for your harassment, threats, or retaliations against me.

You have repeatedly failed to perform to the standards you set forth in the policies, work rules, practices, procedures and ethics described in the Associate Handbook, Prototype Plan, Summary Plan Description, and the Claims Review Procedures Communication. See my previous communications. See Associate Handbook at Section 104 (Business Ethics and Conduct). See Prototype Plan at ¶ 2.4 (Powers and Duties of the Administrator). See Prototype Plan at ¶ 2.10 (Claims Procedure). See Prototype Plan at ¶ 2.11 (Claims Review Procedure). See Summary Plan Description at pages 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 (Article XI Protected Benefits and Claims Procedures). See Claims Review Procedures Communication.

SMA's reputation requires "a scrupulous regard for the highest standards of conduct, ethics and personal integrity". See Associate Handbook at Section 104 (Business Ethics and Conduct).


Change of approach. The position that you present in "RE: Claim for Benefits; Final Decision" is absurd. Furthermore, your position is almost exactly the same -- as in, all you did was open up the file containing "RE: Notice of Adverse Benefit Determination", change the date, title and opening paragraph -- exactly the same, as your position in "RE: Notice of Adverse Benefit Determination", which itself is just a rewording of your initial position made in your initial response to my initial request for information in "401k Account Discrepancy" on July 16, 2012.

Your position was already fully and completely rebutted and discredited.

I explained why your position is absurd on July 23, 2012 in "Breach of contract". Your position has no defense. You have been correctly and repeatedly challenged to present a defense of your position. So far, you have made no discernible attempt.

Instead, you attempted intimidation; continued to misrepresent; and continually ignored every salient fact.

In your communication titled "Hearing - February 13" you insisted that we "avoid any time wasted". This is laughable. You are the person wasting our time. You are the person making indefensible claims. You are the person not defending your claims. You are the person invoking these documents. You are the person that setup these procedures. You are the person claiming to follow these procedures, while simultaneously not following the procedures. I am the person having to repeatedly point out that we are not actually following the procedures. You are the person ignoring me. You are the person communicating with me at 5:49 AM on a Monday, demanding that I communicate with you, about whether I received your communication, about you rescheduling a specious hearing, and then harassing me repeatedly to send you instant communications, about whether I planned to be inside Suite 102 on February 13, 2013 at "10:00", despite my already, and repeatedly, making our situation perfectly clear.


Your policies, work rules, practices, procedures, documents, communications, standards, ethics, and conduct are a farce.

You are the time waster.

You are the person who repeatedly misrepresented these documents.

You are the person who wrongly removed assets from my Account and transferred them to yourself.


Because you have abused your powers and utterly failed to perform the functions of the Administrator, I have invoked the next authority, the US Department of Labor, Employee Benefits Security Administration.

As we discussed on February 12, 2013, I have now filed a Complaint.

The Complaint has been made available to you at: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/162863718/SMAComplaint/Complaint.html</blockquote>
